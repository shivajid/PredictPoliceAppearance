# h2o
This is a Datascience Solution for H2o problem set given.

## Files
 There are two files for the solution
 - h20_exercise_sklearn_keras.ipynb
 - h2o_exercise_h2o3.ipynb
 
 The first file (h20_exercise_sklearn_keras.ipynb). The initial work has been done on this. 
 The work was done for 
  - EDA and 
  - Data Cleansing
  - Feature Selection
  
  The dataset and files are made available in the following dropbox location
  https://www.dropbox.com/sh/pnhf2t0pvspttwr/AACSO8QPs6C-GsJXc-6ejqjsa?dl=0
  
  The second file (h2o_exercise_h2o3.ipynb) contains the h2o model experimentation.
  
  There is an additional notebook with Sythetic Data Generation using TGAN. The dataset has not been used for time constrain reasons.
  
  I hope you will like the exercise.
